# Ecological Forecasting Cyberinfrastructure Terms

## Abstraction

The process of focusing on the design of the IT system architecture and how components relate to one another. *Reference: Fer et al., 2021.*

# Terms from Hendry 2023, "Prediction in Ecology and Evolution"

## Hypothesis

An expectation on system workings for testable predictions. *Reference: Hendry 2023.*

## Prediction

Formal assertion about a state or outcome before it is known. *Reference: Hendry 2023.*

## Expectation

A weaker form of prediction with higher uncertainty. *Reference: Hendry 2023.*

## Question

Inquiry about system information for generating predictions. *Reference: Hendry 2023.*

## Predictable

A precise and accurate state or outcome given adequate system knowledge. *Reference: Hendry 2023.*

## Prophecy (prediction as ...)

A formal prediction about the future state of a system. *Reference: Hendry 2023.*

## Diagnosis (prediction as ...)

A formal prediction about the current state of a system. *Reference: Hendry 2023.*

## History (prediction as...)

A formal prediction about the past state of a system. *Reference: Hendry 2023.*

## Repeatability (prediction as ...)

Phenomena that are repeatable could also be predictable with sufficient knowledge. *Reference: Hendry 2023.*

## Fate (prediction as ...)

When evidence suggests an outcome is inevitable. *Reference: Hendry 2023.*

## Parallel or convergent (in the sense of evolution)

Cases where evolution generates similar outcomes under similar conditions. *Reference: Hendry 2023.*

## Forecasting

Using past or present data to predict the future. *Reference: Hendry 2023.*

## Hindcasting

Using current or past data to predict another past state. *Reference: Hendry 2023.*

## Uncertainty

The level of confidence in a prediction or outcome test. *Reference: Hendry 2023.*
