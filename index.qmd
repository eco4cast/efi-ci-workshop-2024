# EFI Cyberinfrastructure Workshop April 2024

![](images/DSC_7900.JPG)

The lack of widely accepted cyberinfrastructure (CI) design principles poses a major obstacle for researchers and organizations seeking to engage in ecological forecasting. In an effort to address these obstacles, a workshop convened forecasting researchers and CI experts from government, academia, industry, and NGOs to:

1. **Collate** common CI practices currently used  
2. **Identify** CI needs and gaps  
3. **Propose** CI designs for various forecasting problems


## Workshop Outcomes

An objective of the workshop was to create an open-access version-controlled online document. This document was envisioned as a community-developed handbook of CI design principles and recommended practices accessible to the workshop participants and the broader Ecological Forecasting Initiative (EFI) community. The living document is to function as a comprehensive CI guide for both novice and experienced forecasters aligned with community-developed forecasting standards [@dietze2023community].

# How to Contribute

This repository is a collaborative space for the EFI community to design, discuss, and refine cyberinfrastructure (CI) for ecological forecasting. We welcome contributions from all backgrounds and levels of experience.

We use [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) to streamline the deployment of this site. Contributors can write pages in 
[Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) using familiar tools
like RStudio, Jupyter, or Visual Studio Code. This approach allows contributors
to focus on content creation without worrying about styling or 
managing the website deployment.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you start, you will need:

- A GitHub account. You can sign up for one [here](https://github.com/join).
- Git installed on your computer. Follow the instructions [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) to install Git.
- Basic knowledge of Git and GitHub. If you're new to these, we recommend this [tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/hello-world).

### Installation

1. **Fork the repository**

   Click the "Fork" button at the top right of the [efi-ci-workshop-2024 github repository](https://github.com/eco4cast/efi-ci-workshop-2024) to create a copy of this repository under your GitHub account.

2. **Clone your fork**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/efi-ci-workshop-2024.git
   ```
   
3. **Navigate to the repository directory**

   ```bash
    cd efi-ci-workshop-2024
   ```
   
4. **Create a new branch**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b your-branch-name
   ```

## Contributing

1. **Find an issue or task**

   Check the [Issues](https://github.com/eco4cast/efi-ci-workshop-2024/issues) tab to find tasks that need to be completed or discussions that need your input. You can also create new issues or suggest improvements.

2. **Work on your task**

   Once you've selected an issue or task, start working on it in your forked repository. Make sure to keep your changes focused and relevant to the task at hand.
   
3. **Preview the website**

   (Optional) To preview your changes locally, you'll need a Quarto installation.

   There are several ways to work with Quarto. The [Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)
provides detailed instructions on how to install it for RStudio, 
Jupyter, VS Code, and other tools. Once Quarto is installed, you can easily
preview your content using your preferred tool:

::: panel-tabset
## RStudio

Open the RStudio project file in the repo. Now you can render and
preview the site with `quarto::quarto_preview()`. RStudio will pop
up a web browser to preview the site. As you edit files, you can
click the "Render on Save" checkbox, and the website will be updated
whenever you save a change to them.

## Shell / Text Editor

If you're working with lower-level tools like bash and vim, you can
render the site at the shell and start up a preview server with

``` bash
quarto render
quarto preview
```

The `quarto preview` command should open a web page to the correct
location. If it does not, you can see the URL to go to in the
command's output.

## VS Code

Within VS Code install the [Quarto extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quarto.quarto).

To render the site:  
`Ctrl+Shift+K` on PC or `Cmd+Shift+K` on mac. Althernatively, there is a 'Quarto:Preview' button (![preview icon](https://quarto.org/docs/tools/images/vscode-preview-icon.svg)) in the upper right-hand corner that will build the page. 

To execute a single code cell within a qmd:  
`Ctrl+Shift+Enter` on PC or `Cmd+Shift+Enter` on mac.

To close a preview session press `Ctrl+C` on PC or `Cmd+C` on a mac.

:::


4. **Commit your changes** 

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Brief description of your changes"
   ``` 
   
5. **Push your changes to your fork** 

   ```bash
   git push origin your-branch-name
   ```
   
6. **Create a Pull Request**

   Go to your forked repository on GitHub, and you should see a "Compare & pull request" button. Click it and follow the instructions to submit your pull request.
   
7. **Get a review** 

   You can tag someone in particular to review the content you're proposing to add; if you don't tag anyone in particular, one of the repository maintainers will review your PR. 

### Citations

Citing sources in Quarto works just like using BibTeX in a research paper.
First, add your references to the `references.bibtex` file. Then, you can cite 
them directly in the page text. For example, to cite the Ecological Forecasting 
Standards, you would write
`[@dietze2023community]` which renders as [@dietze2023community]. For more information, see the
[quarto help page on citations and
footnotes](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/footnotes-and-citations.html).


## Current documents 

### [Step by Step Summary of Workshop](workshopsummary/summary.qmd) <!-- Link to the summary -->

The workshop's agenda was crafted to cover essential CI design topics recommended by the organizing committee for inclusion in the handbook and to gather valuable input from attendees. Throughout the workshop, we documented the presentations, breakout sessions, and plenary discussions meticulously through detailed notes and audio recording transcripts. These materials were subsequently reviewed and refined to ensure clarity and accuracy in preparation for summarization.

Each workshop session was summarized with the assistance of a Large Language Model AI specifically Claude 3 Opus. We provided the AI with the workshop's annotated agenda, transcripts of audio recordings, presentation slides, and notes along with specific instructions to generate detailed summaries. These instructions were iteratively fine-tuned to ensure the summaries met our standards. Finally, we carefully reviewed the summaries to ensure they accurately reflected the workshop's discussions. Special attention was given to common themes emerging from the breakout sessions which required deeper interpretation and analysis. The collation of those notes can be found in the following document which the community and workshop participants are encouraged to comment on.

### [Briefing Paper](workshopsummary/brief.qmd) <!-- Link to the briefing paper -->

A 1500-word briefing paper has been prepared in lieu of the initially planned community-developed handbook of CI design principles. After collating the workshop materials and reviewing the workshop exit survey, it was apparent that the workshop discussions were held at a higher level than necessary to achieve the initial goal. At this higher non-technical level of discussion, there were existing design principles that participants agreed with, but there are nonetheless obstacles to implementation.

The briefing paper outlines the necessity of cyberinfrastructure (CI) and highlights key thematic obstacles to implementation as identified in the workshop. Additionally, it includes recommendations derived from these themes. The target audience includes potential advocates in agencies, scientific societies, stakeholder groups, and boundary organizations who may not possess technical expertise but can recognize the need for CI. The broader EFI community and workshop participants are encouraged to comment on this briefing paper.

### [Appendix](reference/EFI_CI_reference.qmd) <!-- Link to the appendix -->

The appendix includes acronyms, a glossary of terms, and a list of named participants and their affiliations.
