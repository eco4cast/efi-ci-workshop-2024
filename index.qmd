# EFI Cyberinfrastructure Workshop April 2024

![](images/DSC_7900.JPG)

The lack of widely accepted cyberinfrastructure (CI) design principles poses a major obstacle for researchers and organizations seeking to engage in ecological forecasting. In an effort to address these obstacles, a workshop convened forecasting researchers and CI experts from government, academia, industry, and NGOs to: 1. Collate common CI practices currently used 2. Identify CI needs and gaps 3. Propose CI designs for various forecasting problems

# Workshop Outcomes

An objective of the workshop was to create an open-access version-controlled online document. This document was envisioned as a community-developed handbook of CI design principles and recommended practices accessible to the workshop participants and the broader EFI community. The living document was to function as a comprehensive CI guide for both novice and experienced forecasters aligned with community-developed forecasting standards [@dietze2023community].

## [Briefing Paper](workshopsummary/brief.qmd) <!-- Link to the briefing paper -->

A 1500-word briefing paper has been prepared in lieu of the initially planned community-developed handbook of CI design principles. After collating the workshop materials and reviewing the workshop exit survey, it was apparent that the workshop discussions were held at a higher level than necessary to achieve the initial goal. At this higher non-technical level of discussion, there were existing design principles that participants agreed with, but there are nonetheless obstacles to implementation.

The briefing paper outlines the necessity of cyberinfrastructure (CI) and highlights key thematic obstacles to implementation as identified in the workshop. Additionally, it includes recommendations derived from these themes. The target audience includes potential advocates in agencies, scientific societies, stakeholder groups, and boundary organizations who may not possess technical expertise but can recognize the need for CI. The broader EFI community and workshop participants are encouraged to comment on this briefing paper.

## [Step by Step Summary of Workshop](workshopsummary/summary.qmd) <!-- Link to the summary -->

The workshop's agenda was crafted to cover essential CI design topics recommended by the organizing committee for inclusion in the handbook and to gather valuable input from attendees. Throughout the workshop, we documented the presentations, breakout sessions, and plenary discussions meticulously through detailed notes and audio recording transcripts. These materials were subsequently reviewed and refined to ensure clarity and accuracy in preparation for summarization.

Each workshop session was summarized with the assistance of a Large Language Model AI specifically Claude 3 Opus. We provided the AI with the workshop's annotated agenda, transcripts of audio recordings, presentation slides, and notes along with specific instructions to generate detailed summaries. These instructions were iteratively fine-tuned to ensure the summaries met our standards. Finally, we carefully reviewed the summaries to ensure they accurately reflected the workshop's discussions. Special attention was given to common themes emerging from the breakout sessions which required deeper interpretation and analysis. The collation of those notes can be found in the following document which the community and workshop participants are encouraged to comment on.

# Workshop Organization, Agenda, and Participants

## Participants and Impressions

The workshop participants included a diverse mix of 41 participants from various sectors. Federal agencies were well-represented with 19 participants from 6 different agencies including USGS, NOAA, and NASA. Academia contributed 12 participants from 11 different institutions with international representation from the Finnish Meteorological Institute. The private sector added 5 participants, while NGOs including IOOS regional associations represented the remainder.

According to an exit survey of 28 participants prior to the workshop, the majority of attendees were slightly or moderately knowledgeable of ecological forecasting CI. Around 20% were very knowledgeable, and 7% were not at all knowledgeable. This makeup of participants influenced the scope of the topics covered, focusing more on higher level concepts and general design rather than the technical aspects of cyber infrastructure. Overall, the workshop was well received. It met participants' expectations, with the majority being 'extremely satisfied', although the lack of technical content was noted by several survey respondents.

Reported knowledge gains from the workshop were significant. Participants increased their familiarity with the EFI initiative, NERACOOS, and ecological forecasting cyberinfrastructure in general. There was a strong gain in knowledge about the forecasting cyberinfrastructure of other organizations, increasing from 0% and 11% to 14% and 71% (very knowledgeable and moderately knowledgeable respectively). The strong satisfaction of participants with the workshop was underscored by strong agreement that the workshop facilitated effective collaboration, increased community engagement, and was considered a valuable use of time aligning well with personal goals. Moreover, interactions with workshop organizers and the efficacy of communications were particularly praised. Participants valued the chance to meet peers, learn from diverse CI use cases, and engage in discussions that spanned across multiple perspectives including those focusing on design justice principles. Recommendations for future workshops emphasized a desire for more hands-on experiences with cyberinfrastructure tools, deeper technical discussions, and enhanced skill-building sessions.

## Organizers and Funders

The workshop was co-hosted by EFI and the Northeastern Regional Association for Coastal Ocean Observing Systems (NERACOOS) in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. It was made possible through support from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration/US IOOS, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Northeastern Regional Association of Coastal Ocean Observing Systems, the Ecological Forecasting Initiative, and the U.S. Geological Survey.
