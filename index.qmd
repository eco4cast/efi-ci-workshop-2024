# EFI Cyberinfrastructure Workshop April 2024

![](images/DSC_7900.JPG)

The absence of widely accepted cyberinfrastructure (CI) design principles remains a significant challenge for researchers and organizations involved in ecological forecasting. To tackle these issues, a workshop brought together forecasting researchers and CI experts from government, academia, industry, and NGOs. The key goals of the workshop were to:

1. **Collate** commonly used CI practices  
2. **Identify** CI needs and gaps  
3. **Propose** CI designs to address various forecasting challenges


## Workshop Outcomes

A primary objective of the workshop was to develop an open-access, version-controlled online document. This document is intended to evolve into a community-driven handbook of CI design principles and best practices, accessible to both workshop participants and the broader Ecological Forecasting Initiative (EFI) community. This living document will serve as a comprehensive CI guide, suitable for both beginners and experienced forecasters, and will align with community-established forecasting standards [@dietze2023community].

# How to Contribute

This repository is a collaborative space for the EFI community to design, discuss, and refine cyberinfrastructure (CI) for ecological forecasting. We welcome contributions from all backgrounds and levels of experience.

We use [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) to streamline the deployment of this site. Contributors can write pages in 
[Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) using familiar tools
like RStudio, Jupyter, or Visual Studio Code. This approach allows contributors
to focus on content creation without worrying about styling or 
managing the website deployment.

## Getting Started

### Scope 

Begin by reviewing the [workshop summary documents](workshopsummary/summary.qmd) to familiarize yourself with the key topics discussed during the 2024 workshop. Additionally, read the [briefing paper](workshopsummary/brief.qmd), which outlines the initial CI design principles covered at the event. We welcome and encourage your comments on these materials.

We also invite you to contribute to the [ecological forecasting CI handbook](ci_handbook/index.qmd), which is currently in development and in need of the most input.

### Prerequisites

Before you start, you will need:

- A GitHub account. You can sign up for one [here](https://github.com/join).
- Git installed on your computer. Follow the instructions [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) to install Git.
- Basic knowledge of Git and GitHub. If you're new to these, we recommend this [tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/hello-world).

### Installation

1. **Fork the repository**

   Click the "Fork" button at the top right of the [efi-ci-workshop-2024 github repository](https://github.com/eco4cast/efi-ci-workshop-2024) to create a copy of this repository under your GitHub account.

2. **Clone your fork**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/efi-ci-workshop-2024.git
   ```
   
3. **Navigate to the repository directory**

   ```bash
    cd efi-ci-workshop-2024
   ```
   
4. **Create a new branch**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b your-branch-name
   ```

## Contributing

1. **Find an issue or task**

   Check the [Issues](https://github.com/eco4cast/efi-ci-workshop-2024/issues) tab to find tasks that need to be completed or discussions that need your input. You can also create new issues or suggest improvements.

2. **Work on your task**

   Once you've selected an issue or task, start working on it in your forked repository. Make sure to keep your changes focused and relevant to the task at hand.
   
3. **Preview the website**

   (Optional) To preview your changes locally, you'll need a Quarto installation.

   There are several ways to work with Quarto. The [Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)
provides detailed instructions on how to install it for RStudio, 
Jupyter, VS Code, and other tools. Once Quarto is installed, you can easily
preview your content using your preferred tool:

::: panel-tabset
## RStudio

Open the RStudio project file in the repo. Now you can render and
preview the site with `quarto::quarto_preview()`. RStudio will pop
up a web browser to preview the site. As you edit files, you can
click the "Render on Save" checkbox, and the website will be updated
whenever you save a change to them.

## Shell / Text Editor

If you're working with lower-level tools like bash and vim, you can
render the site at the shell and start up a preview server with

``` bash
quarto render
quarto preview
```

The `quarto preview` command should open a web page to the correct
location. If it does not, you can see the URL to go to in the
command's output.

## VS Code

Within VS Code install the [Quarto extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quarto.quarto).

To render the site:  
`Ctrl+Shift+K` on PC or `Cmd+Shift+K` on mac. Althernatively, there is a 'Quarto:Preview' button (![preview icon](https://quarto.org/docs/tools/images/vscode-preview-icon.svg)) in the upper right-hand corner that will build the page. 

To execute a single code cell within a qmd:  
`Ctrl+Shift+Enter` on PC or `Cmd+Shift+Enter` on mac.

To close a preview session press `Ctrl+C` on PC or `Cmd+C` on a mac.

4. **Commit your changes** 

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Brief description of your changes"
   ``` 
   
5. **Push your changes to your fork** 

   ```bash
   git push origin your-branch-name
   ```
   
6. **Create a Pull Request**

   Go to your forked repository on GitHub, and you should see a "Compare & pull request" button. Click it and follow the instructions to submit your pull request.
   
7. **Get a review** 

   You can tag someone in particular to review the content you're proposing to add; if you don't tag anyone in particular, one of the repository maintainers will review your PR. 

### Images 
Images can greatly enhance your content, but it's important to keep file sizes manageable to avoid slowing down the website. We're using ImageMagick in GitHub Actions to automatically reduce image sizes if the images committed to the repository are larger than 1MB. 

### Citations

Citing sources in Quarto works just like using BibTeX in a research paper.
First, add your references to the `references.bibtex` file. Then, you can cite 
them directly in the page text. For example, to cite the Ecological Forecasting 
Standards, you would write
`[@dietze2023community]` which renders as [@dietze2023community]. For more information, see the
[quarto help page on citations and
footnotes](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/footnotes-and-citations.html).
